# EPM-Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo for the study of electronic transport in bulk semiconductors. Two versions have been developed: in the first one the scattering rates are evaluated at the end of each drift step, whereas in the second case they have been tabulated by sampling over an energy interval.
Project for the "Electronic Properties of Materials" course at Polytechnic University of Turin.
